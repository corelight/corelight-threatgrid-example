# Corelight Threatgrid Example

This script demonstrates an integration used in environments such as Black Hat
conferences. This tool takes files extracted by a Corelight sensor, and uploads
them to Cisco's Secure Malware Analytics (formerly known as Threatgrid) for
in-depth analysis.

# Intended for Example Purposes

While the tool works in demanding situations, it's provided as an example. Its
primary purpose is to demonstrate the potential of integrating Corelight's file
extraction capabilities with Cisco's Secure Malware Analytics platform. If
you're considering using this script in a production environment, we encourage
further testing and customization to ensure it meets your specific needs and
remains effective for long-term deployments.
